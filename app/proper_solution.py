# Leetcode problem â„–42: Trapping Rain Water

# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map
# where the width of each bar is 1,
# compute how much water it can trap after raining.

# Example
# Input: heights = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The elevation map is
# represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
# In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
